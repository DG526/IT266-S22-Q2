{ Hello, and welcome to Elementurmoil! }
"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"

Here, you will use spells of 5 different elements in rock-paper-scissors style combat against various foes.

**PLEASE NOTE: This mod is solely intended for playing alone in Multiplayer mode. It was tested in the Comm Center map. I recommend using that map, as behaviors are untested in others.

=== SPELLS ===

The elements, and what they're good against is as follows:

[B] Fire ==> Ice
         --> Explosion
[H] Ice ==> Explosion
        --> Lightning
[N] Lightning ==> Dark
              --> Fire
[J] Dark ==> Fire
         --> Ice
[M] Explosion ==> Lightning
              --> Dark

*Note: ==> means very effective, --> means somewhat effective. 

If you use a spell effective against the foe, you deal increased damage and are hurt less! However, the same applies to the monster...

When you use spells, they may level up should you win! You get a bit of exp just for using a spell, some more if you use an effective spell, and a lot if you kill a monster with that spell.

In addition to getting stronger, each spell gets a special trait at levels 3 and 5. (Max level is 5.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spell:		@ Lv 3:				@ Lv 5:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fire		50% chance to ignite foe	Heals user slightly.
		for 3-5 turns.

Ice		Reduces damage to user		35% chance to freeze foe
		this turn.			for 2-3 turns.

Lightning	50% chance to stun foe.		15% chance to give user a
						blessing to prevent death
						for 2 turns.

Dark		Heals user proportionally	3% chance to instakill foe.
		to damage dealt.

Explosion	50% chance to stun foe.		60% chance to blind foe
						for 3-5 turns.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your health is also increased by 20 every time a spell levels up. 
(That means your maximum health cap is 600.)

Please remember that if you die, all levels will be reverted to 1!!


=== MONSTERS ===
There are 5 different monsters with their own preferences. Figuring them out can be a good strategy.

When you spawn a monster, they will be given a level between 1 and 6. 6 is DEADLY.
The health and spell levels of the monster are determined by its level. The exp for your spells is also dependent on the level.

To initiate combat press one of the following:
[8] to spawn a random monster at level 1 or 2.
[9] to spawn a random monster at level 3 or 4.
[0] to spawn a random monster at level 5 or 6.


=== ITEMS ===
There are 5 different items you can use to turn the tide of combat!

[1] Medkit. Heals you by 80.
[2] Buffer. Increases the strength of your next spell. Can't be stacked. Can't be used with bolsterers.
[3] Bolsterer. Doubles the exp gained for your next spell. Can be stacked. Can't be used with buffers.
[4] MAD Halfer. Halves the health of both you and your opponent. Risky.
[5] Dokaanomite. Instantly destroys your opponent.

Monsters have a 35% chance of dropping loot of some kind. To boost this to 100%, use the command "luck". Use "luck" again to go back to 35%.

You can also use the command "stockup" to max out your items.


HAVE FUN, AND GOOD LUCK!!
